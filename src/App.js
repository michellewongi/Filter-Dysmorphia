        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Face filters have dominated social media platforms in recent years.
          Popular celebrities and regular social media users alike have shared
          videos of themselves using these filters. Let’s take a step back and
          learn the origin of these filters. In 2015, Snapchat introduced a
          collection of filters called “Lenses” which included puppy ears to
          barfing rainbows. Instagram and Facebook created their own collection
          of filters in 2017, cementing the concept of filters being a key part
          of social media usage. During the same year, Snapchat’s in-house team
          built Snapchat Lens Studio and Facebook introduced Spark AR Studio.
          Both of these softwares gave users the tools necessary to create their
          own filters. In 2018, these 3 big companies began allowing third
          parties to develop face filters on their platform for public use.
          Since then, various AR artists on social media have started sharing
          their own filters.

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
          77% of American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
          members reported patients seeking cosmetic procedures with “looking
          better in selfies” as a driving factor for patients. This was an
          increase of up to 35% overall since the AAFPRS first identified this
          trend in 2016.
        </p>

          90% of the 175 young women and nonbinary people from the study
          reported using filters when posting a selfie. Of these, more than half
          reported using a filter half the time or more.

          popular edits:
